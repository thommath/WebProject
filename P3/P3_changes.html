      <h3>1. Structural changes</h3>

      <!-- <img id="map" src="mockups/NavStructure.png" alt="Sitemap"> -->
      <h4>Folders</h4>
      <p> Our structure has not gone through a lot of transformations, but some
          folders have been either removed or added where we've needed them to make
          things more easily accessible for the programmers. Other things have been
          renamed as we made them, to make it easier to understand what it is. The
          major points will be exlained later in P3.</p>
      <h4>Index changes</h4>
      <p>One notable mention is that we've removed the media index page, and decided
        to mainly use the blog index as the gate that links to both media and images.
        The same goes for the About page, that is now exchanged for another index.html
        and merged with about_panbot.html. Mostly we realised that having two "gate"
        htmls would mean more clicking for people to get where they wanted. Bad design
        bro.</p>
      <h4>Style.css</h4>
      <p>Originally we were going to have one style.css for the whole website, but
          in order to make bugfixing and altering easier, there are now one for the
          header, one for footer and one for body. In addition to some of the pages
          that seemed to need a lot of individual styling.</p>
      <h4>Page names</h4>
      <p>When it comes to page names, we've got the addition of several new index.html.
          These are mostly sites like blog.html, pangen.html, about_panbot.html, etc.
          The reason for this being that we would then be able to make the URLs prettier
          and easier to remember. Instead of having to access panbot.com/media/blog.html,
          the blog will now be accessible through panbot.com/media. Or something similiar
          depending on where we place the webpage on the great internet.</p>

    </article>

    <article id="design">
      <h3>2. Design Changes</h3>

        <h4>Phone</h4>
        <p>
          We we're orignally going to style our site for phone usability, but due
          to short time we had to priorities more important problems
        </p>
        <h4>Colors</h4>
        <img class="mockups" src="colors.png" width="10px" height="10px" alt="farger">
          <p>As we got closer to a complete site, we found that four colors were a bit too
            much, and decided to remove one of them. In addition the beige color was replaced
            with a whiter #FAFAFA to give the website a cleaner look, and complimenting the
            blue and orange better.</p>
        <h4>Fonts</h4>
          <p>We tested several different fonts and decided to go for "Press Start 2P" for
            the header and menus up there, as it was slighty reminicent of robots so we
            found it fitting. For the rest of the site we've decided to go for a less stylized fonts </p>
        <h4>Link styles</h4>
          <p>The part about having an underline under all links have changed a bit, as we assume the user
            will understand that the buttons on the page are actually buttons which link to other pages on the
            site. The underline will be used if there is a link in a text instead.</p>
        <h4>Logo</h4>
          <img id="logo" src="logo.jpg" width="600" alt="logo">
          <p>Our logo is made by a fellow grapical design student, and portrays a small
            cute robot, framed in, and sitting on top of a pile of pancakes. This was
            slightly altered in that the robot was moved in front of the text and the
            font was changed.<p>
        <h4>Scaling</h4>
          <p>As we found time to be an issue, we decided to neglect the scaling and will
            focus on maximising the usablility on computer screens rather than smaller devices. </p>
        <h4>Layout</h4>
          <p>The layout of the gallery has been changed most drasticly. Where instead of
            the slider at the bottom with several images, it's currently restricted to four.
            To counter this we'll add images at the bottom instead. There is also
            no color transition between the thumbnails and the larger image, which was
            originally planned.</p>
          </article>

    <article id="js">
      <h3>3. Javascript funtions</h3>

        <h4>Dropdown menu</h4>
         <p> No change, this is still implemented in the header and makes for easy navigation between the pages. </p>
        <h4>Carousel -> Slideshow</h4>
         <p>Carousel.js has become slideshow.js. This has been changed slightly as
           the other function was a bit too complicated for us, and now we've got
           4 static images under the larger one on top. If you click one of the
           thumbnails, the small image takes the place of the large one. </p>
        <h4>Canvas -> PanGen</h4>
            <p>We changed the name of canvas to become PanGen(Pancake Generator),
            and changed the design on some of the buttons, adding a slider for size
            of the brush. The code is borrowed from <span><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp" target="_blank">here.</a></span></p>
        <h4>Dynamic Time box -> Pancake Advisor</h4>
            <p>Yet another name change and it's now known as Pancake Advisor. One
              would belive that we'd learn to keep the original names, but nooo.</p>
        <h4>Magnifying pictures</h4>
            <p>This function was completely dropped as  </p>
        <h4>Let It Rain</h4>
            <p>This javascript function is completely new! It's an easteregg hidden
              somewhere on the website, can you find it? (Hint: It's on every page.)
              We decided that we needed to add a bit of fun on the page, and this is
              the result.</p>
