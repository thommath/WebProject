      <h3>2. Testing Document</h3>

      <p> We asked our testers if they found our site intuitive.
        Was the navigation easy? Could it be any different?
        We we’re especially interested in what they thought about pangen.
        We also asked what they thought about the styling and what they thought could’ve been different..</p>

      <h3>3. Tester Audience</h3>
        <h4>Testers</h4>
          <p>Although we ran short on time we did our best to get students to test
          our site. Therefore we had mostly student testers with and without coding
          background. We aslo had<!--legg til mer her martin :)--> </p>
          </article>
          <h4>Testing Platforsm</h3>
          <p>
            We let our tester test our site on their prefered devices and browsers
            to simulate the platforms our users would use. This lead to our testers
            tested our website on all sorts of devices and browsers. Mac, Windows, android, iphone, chrome,
            firefox and edge to be more spesific.
          </p>
          <h4>Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Our testers that tried the website on a computer liked the navigation and found it easy to find their way
            to the part of the website they wanted. It worked well on all browsers and operating systems On a phone however they weren't able to navigate
            to the sites they wanted. We also had som critizism aboutthe styling.
            For example everything is horizontally equal, but not
            vertically equal. Also some testers felt like it were just too many
            borders. They felt like too much were going on on our front page with all
            the borders. The footer looked off on some sites. Our submit button on pangen did not work either.

      <h3>4.  Our Respnse and Reflection</h3>
      <h4>Response</h4>
      <p>
        We would definitely fix all the critizism about the styling to make the website
        look more polished. Friendly usability on phones is also something we would really like
        to have because more and more people browse the internet with their phones. We had originally
        planned this, but we realized it wasn't realistic because time was running short. Unfortunately we
        had to priorities meeting all the requiremnts.
        <!-- legg til ting her
            skirv gjerne noe om submit knappen. er det realsitisk å fått den til å funke hvis
          vi hadde hatt mer tid eller ikke?-->
      </p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        We have learned a lot about working as a group on a project. If we had started
        this project from scratch we would have done it a lot different. We were a bit naive
        and mayebe not so realistiv at the start of this project. We distributed work and hoped to tie it all together at
        the end without any problems. We all have our own style of coding so it was hard to tie it all
        together and we ran into a lot of problems during the last week. That lead to us having short
        time and we feel like our website lack polish. If we would have started over again we would have
        many people woriking on each document and more meetings and follow-ups during the middle part
        of the project
