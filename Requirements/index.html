        <p>
          The site’s purpose and goals and how they will be accomplished by the site. Try to draw a connection between the goals and the specific content elements of the site.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We want to share our passion for 2d-printed pancakes. </li>
          <li>The purpose of the site is to document our journey to creating  a fully fledged pancake printer and also create publicity for our project.</li>
          <li>To spread the idea, to get sponsors and donations to make new versions, to motivate tired students during the exam period</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="audience">Target Group</h3>
        <p>
          Who is the intended audience or typical user? Describe them and their need for information and other content.<br>
          <br>
          The users of the site will be people that have an interest in printed foods; the physical tools utilized as to make printed foods reality, as well as the programming aspect of the project. By documenting the whole process we can give clear guidance as to how you can set up your own DIY pancake printer, thereby spreading our passion for pancakes.<br>
          Other users might just want some designer-pancakes, and we believe we can accommodate their requests too.
